                    the different stages in the
                    lifecycle of a project and its development - along with the client and our project supervisor, we
                    agreed so that we would follow the steps outlined below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Initial wireframe designs</li>
                    <li>Design prototype mock-up</li>
                    <li>Backend / feature development</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Surrounding each of these stages we maintained communication both within our team, as well as with
                    our project supervisor and the client.</p>
                <p>We implemented an iterative approach to the process which allowed us to all to air our opinions and
                    move forwards with the project whilst allowing for ideas and designs to change freely and quickly.

                <p class="section__subtitle">These wireframe designs were received very well by the client and were
                    praised for them looking and
                    feeling like something that could be implemented into a real and professional looking product that
                    the client would actually make.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, we collectively decided that we would take a hybrid
                    between the two wireframe designs and create a product that implemented the 'best' parts from each
                    design into the UI/UX prototype.</p>

                            experience in UI Design, he was tasked with implementing the prototype of the core layout
                            for the web app as well as designing some cards for displaying information such as:</p>

                <span class="section__title">Feature Development</span>
                <p class="section__subtitle">Once we had designs that were approved by both the client and the project
                    supervisor, we started
                    to take these designs which up until now were static pages and start to build a data framework
                    around it. For this, I took the lead as I have the most experience in backend development.</p>
                <p>I started by taking the design and breaking the elements into distinct components, such as buttons,
                    navigation items, footers (etc) and converting them, so they are reusable and extensible throughout
                    the application. Once this had been completed I could move onto creating a data structure for the
                    application.</p>
                <p>As this web application is primary used for creating a cart and ordering music from the store, the
                    data for the music had to be organised carefully to allow for a few key pieces of functionality:
                    each release can have different release types (CD, Vinyl, Digital), each of which can have many
                    groupings within them, such as a CD release may have multiple discs. Similarly, within each of these
                    discs (if they exist), there can be many tracks, which may be different to a track on another release
                    type. This problem is compounded by the functionality that links merch to album listings and their
                    tracks.</p>
                <p>Throughout this process we kept in contact with the client to ensure that they were happy with the
                    progress being made and so that we could receive relevant feedback and make changes with the 8 weeks
                    that we had to complete this project from conception to final delivery.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, this project received a grade of 96% (1st), which is accredible in no small part to the
                    great team that we had - our attitudes to succeed and the love and passion that we all had for the
                    project was noted by the client who congratulated us on creating a project that functions the way
                    that it does so quickly and professionally. </p>

                <p>
                    My Job title at Pinewood Technologies is ‚ÄúSoftware Development Placement‚Äù, which means that I am
                    treated mostly like a normal developer, with a few key differences; such as that I have a dedicated
                    mentor that I have access to any time I need help with anything. As well as this, during my
                    placement year, I have a three-week sprint in the User Experience team to build my skills in that
                    area, a presentation on a technical topic relevant to my position in the business, and a three-week
                    sprint with a group of other placements and graduates to build a solution to a business problem from
                    conception to completion ‚Äì all of which are designed to further develop my skills outside of my
                    normal business role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the day to day of my job, I work on any work items assigned to me ‚Äì or pick one up whenever the
                    next priority work item is available ‚Äì I speak to the relevant people involved with the item/ticket
                    to ensure that it is progressing effectively and meeting what is expected of it. I work on code pull
                    requests ‚Äì reviewing other people in the team‚Äôs changes to make sure that they are appropriate, what
                    we expected to change as well as making sure that they follow our coding conventions. Although it is
                    not expected of me in my role, I sometimes work on estimating and grooming work items to get the
                    ready for development. During any of this process, if I have questions about anything I will have a
                    chat to my mentor ‚Äì or bring it up during our daily morning stand-ups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arguably, the main responsibility in my day-to-day role is to ask questions and be inquisitive ‚Äì
                    this is an opportunity for me to learn and grow and Pinewood take it very seriously, by also
                    providing us with opportunities to do things outside of our normal roles, such as the previously
                    mentioned UX, project-based and presentation experiences.

                <span class="section__title">Technology Skills</span>
                <p>
                    During my placement I learnt considerable skills in many web technologies that are extensible
                    outside of the organisation, most of these technologies were something that I had heard of before
                    but my not have necessarily used it in any great detail; being part of the team at Pinewood allowed
                    me to become more exposed to these technologies as well as build my skillset within these
                    technologies at my own pace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These technologies include:
                    <ul class="layout layout__column layout--small">
                        <li>.Net Core (C#)</li>
                        <li>Knockout.js</li>
                        <li>SQL</li>
                        <li>SCSS</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

                <p>
                    One of the most valuable exerpeinces of the placement year was the ability to expand on my personal
                    skills. This was done through a few key experiences within the buisness, such as the presentation I
                    did on a technical topic of my choice;
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to deliver my presentation on the topic on client side viewmodelling, and the technology of
                    Laravel Livewire, as I belived that most people in the audience wouldn't know much about it and
                    would allow me to impart some knowledge on a couple of topics that are relevant to the day to day
                    work I did. Overall, the presentation was well received and it really helped me gain confidence in
                    standing up and talking to people as well as feeling better at my presentation skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another key experience that I throughly enjoyed was the 3 week sprint in the UX team where I had the
                    ability to design and implement a prototype for a dashboard application from scratch; being mentored
                    by the UX team from concept inception all the way to delivering a proptype for the dashboard.
                    Overall this project was very enjoyable as I am a very design and detailed focused person, and I am
                    very proud of the outcome that I delivered for this experience.

                <p>
                    Overall, I believe that the culture at Pinewood being so supportive has been a massive factor in my
                    personal development ‚Äì I have gained more personal skills at this company than any other institution
                    that I have worked at before and I believe that this was because I was set clear and achievable
                    goals at consistent intervals which gave me targets I can meet. I also believe that a large
                    contributing factor to this is the personal relationships I have made with people both in and
                    outside of my direct team, and feeling that I can rely on them not only for support with my direct
                    work, but with anything surrounding my job and know that they will try to help me in any way that
                    they can; and I hope that they also feel the same back. I feel that I should also give myself credit
                    for persevering and trying to improve myself with every opportunity given to me and to try and find
                    work outside of my normal role to try and get a feel and some skills for what some other people in
                    the business do.
