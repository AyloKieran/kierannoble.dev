        <p class="section__subtitle">At the start of this task, the team and myself decided on how to approach
            the different stages in the
            lifecycle of a project and its development - along with the client and our project supervisor, we
            agreed so that we would follow the steps outlined below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Initial wireframe designs</li>
            <li>Design prototype mock-up</li>
            <li>Backend / feature development</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Surrounding each of these stages we maintained communication both within our team, as well as with
            our project supervisor and the client.</p>
        <p>We implemented an iterative approach to the process which allowed us to all to air our opinions and
            move forwards with the project whilst allowing for ideas and designs to change freely and quickly.

        <p class="section__subtitle">These wireframe designs were received very well by the client and were
            praised for them looking and
            feeling like something that could be implemented into a real and professional looking product that
            the client would actually make.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, we collectively decided that we would take a hybrid
            between the two wireframe designs and create a product that implemented the 'best' parts from each
            design into the UI/UX prototype.</p>

                <p>We tried to play to the strenghs of the team, and as Sam was the member with the most
                    experience in UI Design, he was tasked with implementing the prototype of the core layout
                    for the web app as well as designing some cards for displaying information such as:</p>
                <ul class="layout layout__column layout--small">
                    <li>Album listings</li>
                    <li>Event listings</li>
                    <li>Merch listings</li>
                </ul>

    </div>

<section class="section section--secondary">
    <div class="content layout layout__column layout--small">
        <span class="section__title">Feature Development</span>
        <p class="section__subtitle">Once we had designs that were approved by both the client and the project
            supervisor, we started
            to take these designs which up until now were static pages and start to build a data framework
            around it. For this, I took the lead as I have the most experience in backend development.</p>
        <p>I started by taking the design and breaking the elements into distinct components, such as buttons,
            navigation items, footers (etc) and converting them, so they are reusable and extensible throughout
            the application. Once this had been completed I could move onto creating a data structure for the
            application.</p>
        <p>As this web application is primary used for creating a cart and ordering music from the store, the
            data for the music had to be organised carefully to allow for a few key pieces of functionality:
            each release can have different release types (CD, Vinyl, Digital), each of which can have many
            groupings within them, such as a CD release may have multiple discs. Similarly, within each of these
            discs (if they exist), there can be many tracks, which may be different to a track on another release
            type. This problem is compounded by the functionality that links merch to album listings and their
            tracks.</p>
        <p>Throughout this process we kept in contact with the client to ensure that they were happy with the
            progress being made and so that we could receive relevant feedback and make changes with the 8 weeks
            that we had to complete this project from conception to final delivery.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, this project received a grade of 96% (1st), which is accredible in no small part to the
            great team that we had - our attitudes to succeed and the love and passion that we all had for the
            project was noted by the client who congratulated us on creating a project that functions the way
            that it does so quickly and professionally. </p>
