        <h2 class="section__subtitle">A-Level Photography Component Two & Exam - Marked at Grade A</h2>
        <p>‘Photographing part of an object, view or person can
            be a way of creating abstract imagery or observing the
            subject more closely. Sonya Noskowiak often recorded
            very carefully selected portions of her subjects to
            direct attention to their detail and textural qualities.
            Judith Turner’s photographs of columns and leaves are
            often severely cropped to emphasize the repeated shapes
            and forms seen in close-up sections of her subjects. At
            times Patrick Caulfield’s paintings show just part of
            an interior, leaving the viewer to imagine what is left
            outside the frame. Produce your own response, making
            reference to appropriate work by others.’ <strong>(96 Marks)</strong></p>

        <p>
            My Job title at Pinewood Technologies is “Software Development Placement”, which means that I am
            treated mostly like a normal developer, with a few key differences; such as that I have a dedicated
            mentor that I have access to any time I need help with anything. As well as this, during my
            placement year, I have a three-week sprint in the User Experience team to build my skills in that
            area, a presentation on a technical topic relevant to my position in the business, and a three-week
            sprint with a group of other placements and graduates to build a solution to a business problem from
            conception to completion – all of which are designed to further develop my skills outside of my
            normal business role.
