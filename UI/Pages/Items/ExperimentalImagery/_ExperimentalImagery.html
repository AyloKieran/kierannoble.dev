        <p>
            In Component One of my Photography A-Level, I was given the topic of “Experimental Imagery”, which I
            interpreted as a way to try and bend the ‘rules’ of photography and create something that isn’t usually seen
            within the world of photography.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within this, I tried to investigate techniques new and old that aren’t seen much because they are often seen
            as “too experimental” or out of the contemporary world, within these themes I explored ways to portray the
            world and people in a way that may make the viewer think twice about what they are seeing as well as how it
            should make them feel.

        <p>
            The project initially started with looking at how colour can affect a viewer’s experience of a photograph.
            Focusing first on how the lack of colour and artificial depth looks, before moving more into selective use
            of colour as well as creating artificial colour in a photo.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this process I began to look at how the shape of colour matters – using bokeh and colour together to
            control a viewer’s perception of a location. At this time, I also began to look into how video can be used
            to further increase a viewer’s connection to a location.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this I began to look into how I could ‘destroy’ a photo just enough to warp a viewer’s perception of
            an image, but not so much that it is no longer recognisable. One technique that I really liked, but ended up
            not making it into the final investigation was creating something that felt unnatural, but used human hands,
            the results of this can be seen below:

            As well as this, another favourite image of mine from this project is where I split the colours and blurred
            a model’s face to give a sense of broken and unrecognisable to the viewer – where they couldn’t see the
            facial features of the person but could see the rest in a ‘broken world’. The result of this can be seen
            below:

        <p>
            Moving towards the end of the project, I began to once again look at how the world of photography, which is
            generally a snapshot of time in a single image, could move more towards the world of video and more so the
            motion of the world within the photographs.
        </p>
        <p>
            This method of motion in a single still photo was inspired by Mura Masa ‘s music video ‘What If I Go?’,
            which used a digital form of a style of 3D photography, popularised by the Nimslo 3D film camera from the
            1980s, where I used the same moment in time but with multiple shots from slightly differing angles, to give
            a ‘frozen in time’ sense to the viewer, were they can see more than they should be able to. I then used
            these frames to create a looping gif, such as the ones below:
        </p>

        <p>
            From this, I developed a look that was similar to Super8 film, and incorporated it into a ‘music video’
            style outcome, which used the techniques developed throughout the project to give a futuristic and
            old-fashioned contract to the viewer, within a confusing yet motion-filled outcome that bends the rules of
            photography and what is expected both from the artist and the viewer
