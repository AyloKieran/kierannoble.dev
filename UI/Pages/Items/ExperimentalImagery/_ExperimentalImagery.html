            My Job title at Pinewood Technologies is “Software Development Placement”, which means that I am
            treated mostly like a normal developer, with a few key differences; such as that I have a dedicated
            mentor that I have access to any time I need help with anything. As well as this, during my
            placement year, I have a three-week sprint in the User Experience team to build my skills in that
            area, a presentation on a technical topic relevant to my position in the business, and a three-week
            sprint with a group of other placements and graduates to build a solution to a business problem from
            conception to completion – all of which are designed to further develop my skills outside of my
            normal business role.
