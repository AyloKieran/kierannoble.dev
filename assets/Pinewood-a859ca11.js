help with anything. As well as this, during my placement year, I have a three-week sprint in the User Experience team to build my skills in that area, a presentation on a technical topic relevant to my position in the business, and a three-week sprint with a group of other placements and graduates to build a solution to a business problem from conception to completion – all of which are designed to further develop my skills outside of my normal business role."}),e("p",{children:"In the day to day of my job, I work on any work items assigned to me – or pick one up whenever the next priority work item is available – I speak to the relevant people involved with the item/ticket to ensure that it is progressing effectively and meeting what is expected of it.

Although it is not expected of me in my role, I sometimes work on estimating and grooming work items to get the ready for development.

Overall, the presentation was well received and it really helped me gain confidence in standing up and talking to people as well as feeling better at my presentation skills."}),e("p",{children:"Another key experience that I throughly enjoyed was the 3 week sprint in the UX team where I had the ability to design and implement a prototype for a dashboard application from scratch; being mentored by the UX team from concept inception all the way to delivering a proptype for the dashboard.

I also believe that a large contributing factor to this is the personal relationships I have made with people both in and outside of my direct team, and feeling that I can rely on them not only for support with my direct work, but with anything surrounding my job and know that they will try to help me in any way that they can; and I hope that they also feel the same back.
